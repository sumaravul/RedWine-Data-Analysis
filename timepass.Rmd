```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
## load all the libraries required for analysis

``` library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(dbplyr)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(memisc)
library(psych)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(markdown)
```

## Read the file that stores the redwine data
``` 
Red_wine<-read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')
```
##Red wine data has 1599 observations with 13 variables

##There is a column X which is not useful in the analysis hence deleting the column

```
Red_wine$X<-NULL
Red_wine
```

## Univarient analysis

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

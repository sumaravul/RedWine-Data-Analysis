## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(dbplyr)
library(gridExtra)
library(scales)
library(memisc)
library(psych)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(markdown)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
